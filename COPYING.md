The libtabula source code and the reference manual derived from
comments in the library source code are licensed under the [GNU Lesser

The libtabula User Manual is licensed under [a unique license][2]
derived from the [Linux Documentation Project License][3].

(The changes are due to the fact that the User Manual isn't actually
part of [TLDP][4], so a lot of the language in their license doesn't
make sense when applied to the libtabula user manual.)
