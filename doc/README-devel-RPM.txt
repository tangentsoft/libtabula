libtabula-devel RPM installs the files you need when building your
own libtabula based programs, as well as documentation and examples
that can help you learn how to use the library.

The libtabula header files are in /usr/include/libtabula, the
library is in /usr/lib, and the example programs' source code is
in /usr/share/doc/libtabula-devel-*/examples.  For more information
on the examples, see the README-examples.md file in the directory
containing the examples.
