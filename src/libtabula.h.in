/// This file brings in all Libtabula headers except for custom.h and
/// custom-macros.h which are a strictly optional feature of Libtabula.
///
/// There is no point in trying to optimize which headers you include,
/// because the Libtabula headers are so intertwined.  You can only get
/// trivial compile time benefits, at the expense of clarity.

	\mainpage Libtabula Reference Manual

	\section getting_started Getting Started

	The best place to get started is the
	<a href="../userman/index.html">user manual</a>. It provides
	a guide to the example programs and more.


	\section classes Major Classes

	In Libtabula, the main user-facing classes are
	libtabula::Connection, mysqlpp::Query, mysqlpp::Row,
	libtabula::StoreQueryResult, and mysqlpp::UseQueryResult.

	In addition, Libtabula has a mechanism called Specialized SQL
	Structures (SSQLS), which allow you to create C++ structures
	that parallel the definition of the tables in your database
	schema. These let you manipulate the data in your database using
	native C++ data structures. Programs using this feature often
	include very little SQL code, because Libtabula can generate most
	of what you need automatically when using SSQLSes. There is a
	whole chapter in the user manual on how to use this feature of
	the library, plus a section in the user manual's tutorial chapter
	to introduce it. It's possible to use Libtabula effectively without
	using SSQLS, but it sure makes some things a lot easier.


	\section files Major Files

	The only two header files your program ever needs to include
	are libtabula.h, and optionally custom.h. (The latter implements
	the SSQLS mechanism.) All of the other files are used within
	the library only.


	\section user_questions If You Have Questions...

	If you want to email someone to ask questions about this library,
	we greatly prefer that you send mail to the Libtabula mailing list,
	which you can subscribe to here: http://lists.mysql.com/plusplus

	That mailing list is archived, so if you have questions, do a
	search to see if the question has been asked before.

	You may find people's individual email addresses in various
	files within the Libtabula distribution. Please do not send mail
	to them unless you are sending something that is inherently
	personal. Questions that are about Libtabula usage may well be
	ignored if you send them to our personal email accounts. Those of
	us still active in Libtabula development monitor the mailing list,
	so you aren't getting any extra "coverage" by sending messages
	to those addresses in addition to the mailing list.


	\section licensing Licensing

	Libtabula is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License,
	which you should have received with the distribution package in
	a file called "LGPL" or "LICENSE". You can also view it here:
