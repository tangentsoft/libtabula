	/// know the current character set, which affects how we do SQL
	/// escaping.
	/// 
	/// You probably should not use this function directly, but
	/// instead use the mysqlpp::escape manipulator with SQLStream,
	/// since that always does the best possible thing in the given
	/// circumstances.
	///
	/// In fact, you probably shouldn't use this *at all* because it
	/// implies that you're trying to build valid SQL for an invalid
	/// DB connection.  It also means you're willing to settle for our
	/// generic rules, while your DBMS's escaping mechanism may give
	/// better results, being tuned to that DBMS's expectations.

	/// of the parameters and the return value
