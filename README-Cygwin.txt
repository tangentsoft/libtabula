Prerequisite: Install Database Engine Development Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Before you can build libtabula, you need to install the development
    files for the database engines you want it to wrap.  As of this
    writing, libtabula on Cygwin supports MySQL and SQLite via the
    libmysqlclient-devel and libsqlite3-devel packages with Cygwin's
    setup*.exe.


Building the Library and Example Programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Having done that, Cygwin behaves like any other Unixy system.
    See the instructions in README-Unix.txt.
