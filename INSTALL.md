Installing libtabula
====

The installation procedure depends on the compiler you use to build
libtabula and on the OS you build it on.  There are platform-specific
instructions for all popular platforms:

* [Cygwin](README-Cygwin.md)
* [Linux](README-Linux.md)
* [Mac OS X](README-Mac-OS-X.md)
* [MinGW](README-MinGW.md)
* [Solaris](README-Solaris.md)
* [Visual C++](README-Visual-C%2b%2b.md)

If you're on some Unix variant (Linux, OS X, \*BSD, Solaris,
Cygwin...)  there are additional general instructions in [the Unix
README](README-Unix.md).

See [the main README file](README.md) for high-level instructions
that apply to all platforms libtabula works on.
