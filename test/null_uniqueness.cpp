/***********************************************************************
 test/null_uniqueness.cpp - Code for checking that null_type cannot be
	converted to anything else.  Because it triggers a compile-time
	check, it can't be included in the test suite.  You have to just
	try building it.  Comment out the assignment to int to check that
	the return statement also triggers the compile-time check.
